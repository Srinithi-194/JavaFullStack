They are the fundamental building blocks of the universe, each varying widely in size, shape, and structure. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is just one of the approximately two trillion galaxies estimated to exist in the observable universe.

The concept of a galaxy has evolved significantly over time. In the early 20th century, astronomers believed that the Milky Way was the entire universe. It wasn't until Edwin Hubble's groundbreaking observations in the 1920s that we understood that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies. Hubble's discovery of Cepheid variable stars in the Andromeda Galaxy (then known as the Andromeda Nebula) allowed him to calculate its distance, proving that it lay far outside the Milky Way and thus confirming the existence of other galaxies.</p>
